					<h1>The many lives of a notification</h1>
					<img src="./assets/cat-gallery.jpg" alt="a series of colorful cat illustrations">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Hello everyone! Welcome, and thanks for coming to this presentation! Today, I'd like to talk to you about cats.</p>
						<p>See, I used to foster kittens somewhat frequently. Normally I would get a group of two or three kittens, which is a really fantastic thing to do. Kittens can really improve your day-to-day life a lot richer, and improve your overall experience.</p>
						<p>However, sometimes I would get a batch of 5 or 6 kittens. It turns out there is such a thing as too many kittens. They end up taking over every moment of your waking (and often sleeping) life, and prevent you from focusing on literally anything else.</p>
						<p>(and they generate a lot of poop, but that's not part of the metaphor)</p>
						<p>So on that note, let's talk about live regions!</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<label for="example-input1">Find notification terms</label>
					<div><input type="text" id="example-input1" class="terms-input" data-results="example-results1"></div>
					<ul id="example-results1" class="terms-list"></ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>REMEMBER: Type into the actual slide, not the notes.</p>
						<p>I made this example to show what a live region is, and why you might need one. This is a working filter or search field, and it dynamically updates every time I type into the field.</p>
						<p>Because I can see, this works really well. As I type, I can immediately see feedback on what results are returned, and catch any typos.</p>
					</aside>

					<label for="example-input1">Find notification terms</label>
					<div><input type="text" id="example-input2" class="terms-input" data-results="example-results2"></div>

					<div class="cat-list" aria-hidden="true"></div>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>WARNING: there will be flying cats across this screen.</p>
						<p>Now I've added a small visual aid to show what it's like when you have an overly verbose, too frequent live region on the page. It interrupts everything, is extremely distracting, and can prevent you from perceiving what is going on with the UI control you want to interact with.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Notifications: a field guide</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>To start off, I'd like to first take you on a tour of the types of notifications you might find out in the wild</p>
						<p>There are going to be a number of illustrations of cats on these slides, and almost all of the hand-drawn images are from Ed Gorey (who illustrated T.S. Eliot's Possum's book of practical cats), and Andy Warhol</p>

							<li>herds cats at Microsoft</li>

							<li>looks at lots and lots of products</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						I'll be your guide for this section. A major part of my role at Microsoft is to review code and assist developers in fixing accessibility bugs. Unsurprisingly, over the past year or so of doing that, I've come across quite a number of different live regions in the wild. For your benefit (and mine) I've compile those into a handy guide.

					<h3>Human Interaction</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>No control</li>
						<li>No review</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="./assets/cat1.jpg" alt="green cute but obstinate cat illustration">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Before going further, I think it's worth emphasizing two fundamental behaviors of live regions. Usually, someone using a screen reader has control over what sort of output they hear. Keyboard commands, etc.</p>
						<p>Live regions in contrast are entirely in the control of the author, not the user.</p>
						<p>Also, unlike any text that a user is directly interacting with, live regions cannot be reviewed.</p>

					<h3>Classifications and terms</h3>
					<img src="./assets/cat-diagram.png" alt="abstract anatomical diagram of a cat" style="width: 80%">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>If you're going to talk about cats, you need to know some terms. Tabby, calico, house cat, long hair, persian, things like that.</p>
						<p>So let's start by going over some of the ways we classify notifications, and some of the characteristics you may observe. This will help you identify and distinguish between the different types when you encounter them.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>What is a &ldquo;Live Region&rdquo;?</h4>
					<p class="text-emphasis"><code>aria-live</code></p>
					<img src="./assets/assertive-polite-arrows.png" alt="" style="max-width:30%;">
					<p><span class="large">assertive</span> <span class="small" style="display:inline-block;margin:0 2em;">vs.</span> <span class="large">polite</span></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>ARIA Roles</h4>
					<div style="display: flex;align-items: center;">
						<ul aria-label="the common roles">
							<li>alert</li>
							<li>status</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="./assets/common-roles.png" alt="the common roles: good support and wide use" style="max-width:40%">
					</div>
					<div class="fragment" style="display: flex;align-items: center;">
						<ul aria-label="the rare varieties">
							<li>log</li>
							<li>marquee</li>
							<li>timer</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="./assets/other-roles.png" alt="the other roles: poor or support and danger of extinction" style="max-width:50%">
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, and is a supplement to HTML</p>
						<p>Alert and status are the most common types of ARIA live regions. Alert is, as it sounds, an assertive announcement. Status provides a polite announcement.</p>
						<p>We'll talk more about the lesser-used roles later, but one reason you don't see them much is they don't have good assistive tech support.</p>
						<p>A role determines not only how the live region behaves, but also imparts semantics. So, for example, an alert role will cause the notification to be read immediately, and also adds "alert" semantic meaning.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>ARIA attributes</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><code style="display:inline-block;width:9em;">aria-atomic</code> <span style="display:inline-block;width:2em;">:</span> what is read?</li>
						<li><code style="display:inline-block;width:9em;">aria-relevant</code> <span style="display:inline-block;width:2em;">:</span> when is it read?</li>
						<li><code style="display:inline-block;width:9em;">aria-busy</code> <span style="display:inline-block;width:2em;">:</span> maybe don't read this.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="./assets/attr-support.png" alt="these attributes have poor or no support" style="max-width:40%;margin-top:1em;">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>We already talked about aria-live, but these other attributes define how a live region should behave.</p>
						<p>All ARIA live region attributes define how a live region should behave, but not any semantic meaning. You can create a live region from scratch with no role using only attributes, or modify how a live region role behaves.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>The &lt;output&gt; element</h4>
					<blockquote>The output element represents the result of a calculation performed by the application, or the result of a user action.</blockquote>
					<p>(Also, just read <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/07/10/the-output-element.html">Scott's article</a>)</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The definition is from the HTML spec. The output element is mapped to a role of status, and that is implemented in all browsers but Firefox and Android browsers (according to Scott, whose research I shamelessly copied here.)

						<p>As single page apps are now much more common, often the loading of content and assets happens asynchronously, and not through the browser's default page load events. This requires handling loading and loaded announcements manually.</p>

						<p>Both form field errors and success messages that are displayed on screen as the user moves through a form should also be communicated to screen reader users.</p>
						<p>Whether the type for inline errors should be polite or assertive is a bit subjective.</p>
						<p>Medium risk b/c there's a high chance of conflict with focus changes, and missing errors can be a major cause of frustration when trying to understand how to complete a form.</p>

						<p>Toasts are a particular pest for magnification users</p>

						<p>Using live regions to try to patch real or perceived gaps in ARIA support is always a bad idea. Live regions add an extra layer of fragility, particularly when conflicting with user actions (as it will here). They are also custom and non-standard, meaning users cannot learn how to use a control across the entire web.</p>
						<p>Instead: use standard, supported controls. Break complex UI into standard chunks. Or, if needed, write a keyboard/AT help page that details how to use it instead of embedding those instructions in live regions. Remember: live regions aren't reviewable.</p>

					<img src="./assets/cat-books.jpg" alt="A cat surrounded by bookshelves looking out a window">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Why?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Notification text can't be easily reviewed</li>
							<li>Distracts and interrupts user interaction</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you can see, you can visually scan the number of results returned without reading each one, until you choose to. Give the same experience to screen reader users. This is especially true for large blocks of updating content, like search results region or data table.</p>
						<p>Lean towards custom notification text, and write that as concise as possible</p>

					<img src="./assets/ascii-cat.jpg" alt="overly cute cat drawn with ascii art">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Why?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Notification text cannot be reviewed character-by-character</li>
							<li>Many text-to-speech engines and verbosity settings will ignore them</li>
							<li>Support is lacking for non-text content</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>3. Set a timeout to remove notification text</h3>
					<img src="./assets/row-of-cats.jpg" alt="cat with top hat magically conjures row of identical cats">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Screen reader-only notifications</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Why?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Reduces duplicate announcements</li>
							<li>Avoids reading all previons announcements</li>
							<li>Allows repeating the same announcement</li>
						</ul>
						<p>See: common bug where all text is read if new text is added, even if aria-atomic is false. Depending on how you handle updates, if you simply replace the notification text, you can't announce the same thing multiple times in a row.</p>

					<h3>4. Handle insertion vs. updates wisely</h3>
					<div class="left">
						<div class="fragment alert-visual" role="alert">
							Alert 1
						</div>
						<div class="fragment alert-visual" role="alert">
							Alert 1
						</div>
						<div class="fragment alert-visual" role="alert">
							Alert 1
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						<div class="status-visual fragment">
							<span class="small">An empty aria-live element</span>
							<div class="fragment status-visual-item">
								Update 1
							</div>
							<div class="fragment status-visual-item">
								Update 2
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Why?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Support gaps for dynamic insertion (this is only reliable with the alert role)</li>
							<li>Certain role + attribute combinations cause duplicate announcements</li>
							<li>For updates, support is better if the element exists at or close to page load</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>5. Create a notification service</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Complex apps with many notifications</li>
							<li>App-wide notifications, toast notifications</li>
							<li>Frequent conflicting notifications</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Why?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Prevents conflicts</li>
							<li>Centralizes debugging work</li>
							<li>Ensures the live region is present on page load</li>
						</ul>
						
						By "notification service" I mean a centralized, top-level component that handles creating custom notification announcements, that lower-level components can simply invoke with a text string and options.
						<p>Also, fewer live regions in the page means better performance. Handles the other nuances for you, so you don't need to remember to look support up every time.</p>

					<h3>6. Create a notifications center</h3>
					<img src="./assets/notification-center.png" alt="github notification center showing icon and notification inbox">
					<aside class="notes">
					<p>When?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Complex apps with many notifications</li>
						<li>Toast notifications</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Why?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Solves magnification problems</li>
						<li>Solves timeout issues, if timeouts exist</li>
						<li>Easily reviewable</li>
					</ul>
						By "notification service" I mean a centralized, top-level component that handles creating custom notification announcements, that lower-level components can simply invoke with a text string and options.
						<p>e learned nothing else, I hope you've learned that notifications fail easily. A notification center creates a failsafe. Also, solves issues with live text not being easily reviewable word-by-word for screen reader users</p>

					<h3>7. Debug with a mutation observer</h3>
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="js">
						function observeElement(element) {
						  const onMutuate = function(mutationsList, observer) {
						    for(let mutation of mutationsList) {
						      if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
						        console.log('A child node has been added or removed.');
						      }
						      else if (mutation.type === 'attributes') {
						        console.log(`${mutation.attributeName} was modified.`);
						      }
						    }
						  };
						  const observer = new MutationObserver(onMutuate);
						  observer.observe(element, config);
						}
					</code></pre>
					<!--TODO: I will be fixing contrast in the code-->
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I keep this saved in a gist for when I need it</p>
						<p>With single page app frameworks like React, sometimes you can unintentionally remove and re-insert the live region element in the DOM if you aren't careful. The mutation observer lets you see exactly what DOM changes are occurring. Try adding it to a wrapper element around the live region element</p>
						<p>Fun tip! You can also sometimes use this to debug other accessibility issues with dynamic content, particularly around inserting/removing content, or if the virtual cursor or focus is being unexpectedly lost.</p>

					<h3>8. Don't use a live region!</h3>
					<img src="./assets/dog.jpg" alt="child looking at three dogs">
					<aside class="notes">Like cats, live regions aren't always the best choice</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Instead:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Move focus</li>
						<li>Write clear UI instructions</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>One example: on a single page app page change, consider moving focus to the new content container, instead of firing a live region. Also has the benefit of bypassing blocks.</p>
						<p>Other example: a checkbox that enables more form fields doesn't need a live region if the instructions are good enough</p>
