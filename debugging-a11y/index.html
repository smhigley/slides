					<h2>This talk is <strong>not</strong> about:</h2>

						<li class="fragment">how to test</li>

					<h2>Why debugging?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						So why debugging specifically? It's because for me, that's usually the part of the learning process where I feel most lost (even outside of a11y)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The accessibility process (imagination)</h3>
					<div class="left">
						<ol class="content-list">
							<li>Learn: semantic HTML, tabbing, yay!</li>
							<li>Test</li>
							<li>Fix bugs</li>
							<li>Include everyone!</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						<img src="./assets/eager.jpg" alt="Retsuko is starry-eyed and eager, surrounded by bishie sparkles">
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						So tell me if this story sounds familiar: you're working on learning a skill, or getting your footing in a field. You soak up tutorials, articles, and talks. Then whenever you strike out on your own, you rapidly get mired in some unforseen problem and get stuck without a roadmap.
						<p>Like when I bought my first car, which was a ~15 year old new england rust bucket, and when trying to fix it up...</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The accessibility process (reality)</h3>
					<div class="left">
						<ol class="content-list">
							<li>Learn: semantic HTML, tabbing, yay!</li>
							<li>Testing happens</li>
							<li>...</li>
							<li>...</li>
							<li>... ... what is aria-required-children??!</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						<img src="./assets/overworked.jpg" alt="Aggretsuko staggers under a huge pile of papers with deep shadows under her eyes, surrounded by little blue flames">
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>... I rapidly proceeded to sheer the head off a bolt, and was then just ... stuck.</p>
						<p>And everything I knew up until that point had not told me what to do when something went wrong and I went off the rails.</p>
						<p>Maybe this is just my perception, but I've found a lot of resources out there both about how to test (and great testing tools like aXe, accessibility insights, and others), and also on how to build or make specific patterns, like dialogs or SPA navigation. But not a lot on how to actually troubleshoot or move forward when stuck (which is one of the places I struggle most when learning a new skill)</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>My learning process:</h3>
					<ul class="sequential-overlays">
						<li>
							<img src="./assets/learn-step1.jpg" alt="Retsuko working calmly at her computer during the day">
						</li>
						<li class="fragment step">
							<img src="./assets/learn-step2.jpg" alt="Retsuko working at her computer during the evening, looking burnt out and surrounded by piles of books and paper">
						</li>
						<li class="fragment step">
							<img src="./assets/learn-step3.gif" alt="Retsuko in a dark room at night running around her desk screaming">
						</li>
						<li class="fragment step" aria-hidden="true">
							<img src="./assets/learn-step4.jpg" alt="">
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This isn't made any easier by the way a lot of us approach learning (or maybe it's just me): the way I learned web dev, javascript, and accessibility was largely isolated, because:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I was afraid to ask for help, yay imposter syndrome</li>
							<li>Often companies only have one accessibility person, and even that is if you're lucky (I didn't always work at Microsoft).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>As a result, I ended up struggling through learning a lot of this on my own, which is a very lonely and stressful way to learn.</p>
						<p>It also causes a lot of doubts: am I missing something really obvious? Am I looking at the right things? Do other people find this hard too? There must be a really obvious solution to this that I'm just not smart enough to see, etc.</p>
						<p>I really don't recommend this way of learning.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>This talk <strong>is</strong> about:</h2>
					<img src="./assets/rage-work.jpg" alt="aggretsuko, an aggrieved red panda, working furiously at her computer as papers go flying" style="width: 80%;">
					<p class="fragment">frustration.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This talk is about that feeling when you've been working on one problem for far too long, and you still have no idea how to solve it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>A better option:</h3>
					<img src="./assets/pairing.jpg" alt="Retsuko looking at her computer while Haida watches over her shoulder, both looking nonplussed.">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>And it's also about finding or making a better option:</p>
						<p>Good communication with coworkers who have domain expertise in the thing you want to learn is a good way to mitigate this. Pair programming (or just pairing) is a great method to get direct insight into how other people do things</p>
						<p>But as mentioned, a11y folks can be a bit isolated work-wise, and sometimes there aren't a lot of opportunities to pair specifically on accessibility.</p>
					</aside>

					<p>Let's do this.</p>

					<h2>Bug 1: the dreaded &lt;table&gt;</h2>
					<img src="./assets/table-ex1.png" alt="screenshot of a simple-looking table with information about books">
					<p class="small">"NVDA's table commands aren't working properly..."</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>We're going to jump right in the deep end with a bug logged on a table. This specific hypothetical bug is that when navigating a table, a screen reader (specifically NVDA in this case) is not moving between cells as expected when using ctrl + alt + arrow keys.</p>

						<p>When I get a bug like this about a screen reader not properly parsing a component or web page, I actually rarely jump directly to screen reader testing. Instead, I look directly at the accessibility information on the page itself.</p>
						<p>Even though this particular bug mentions NVDA, parsing issues like this are likely to reproduce across different screen readers.</p>

					<h2>Bug 2: the screen reader cursor is "lost"</h2>
					<img src="./assets/actions-menu.png" alt="An open file actions dropdown menu with three actions: save, edit, and delete" style="width: 60%;">
					<aside class="notes">This bug is logged on a dropdown menu (a programmatic menu, not a navigation menu), where after activating one of the items, the menu closes and the screen reader (JAWS) is jumped somewhere else (i.e. the top of the page). Tabbing still seems to work, though.</aside>

						<p>Virtual cursor bugs can be notoriously finicky across different screen readers and browsers, so AT can be useful to test. DevTools is going to be wayyy more helpful though</p>

					<h3>Does it reproduce?</h3>

					</figure>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>It *can* be useful to test if something that happens in one browser/SR pair also reproduces in other browser/SR pairs (doesn't need to be in this depth). In this case, I did tests and inexplicably it does not reproduce in NVDA/FF and macOS/VO. It does reproduce on iOS/VO, and all other Windows SR combos. This doesn't tell us much, but at least we now know that it's not a consistent thing. Still doesn't really tell us why, though. </p>

					<h3>Observing focus changes</h3>
					<a href="examples/menu.html">Menu example page</a>
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="js">
						document.activeElement
					</code></pre>
					<div class="center">or</div>
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="js">
						document.addEventListener('focusin', () => {
							console.log(document.activeElement);
						});
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Deduction: when weird screen reader things happen at the same time as programmatic focus management, the first thing to suspect should be that something is going on with focus. Even though tabbing appears to work fine, it's a good idea to observe what *exactly* is going on with actual keybaord focus before moving on.</p>
						<p>To do this, we can use the console rather than the elements pane or accessibility inspector. And document.activeElement is your friend :)</p>
						<p>(also mention focusin vs. focus)</p>

					<p class="small">"VoiceOver isn't reading the index of the menu items"</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Someone, perhaps the same person as logged the previous bug, tested the same menu with VO on iOS and found that VO does not read the index of actions in a menu.

						<p>SO this time I'm actually going to use a screen reader to debug, and not just to test.</p>
						I knew including screen readers and other assistive tech in here would be controversial, since some people think people who do not personally rely on assistive tech should not test with it. Because they will not know how to interpret the results. I have personally found this to often be this case.

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Reminder: this is not about how to test with a screen reader, but how to debug.</li>
							<li>COMPARE. Compare to something you *know* is correct for the same platform and assistive tech. Make a plain example with semantic HTML. Use MDN or ARIA Practices (sometimes).</li>
							<li>Bug Steps: Are the semantics correct? Can I reproduce on a vanilla list of links with the same browser/SR?</li>
							<li>Don't rely on your own "intuition" about how a screen reader "should" work if you don't use one every day</li>
							<li>SR experimentation doesn't cross platforms well: if you're primarily familiar with VoiceOver, you won't know Windows SRs, same with mobile/swiping interactions</li>

					<h4>This applies to more than screen readers!</h4>

					<aside class="notes">
						Check your styled link-button hybrid in high contrast mode against a plain, unstyled HTML button in HCM. Different = real bug; same = no bug.
						<p>This only works well for atomic patterns. Never assume you can evaluate page-level usability or navigation patterns with an AT you do not rely on.</p>
						<p>Other things you can compare against: although it has flaws as pattern guidance, the APG examples give a good reference for composite widgets built according to spec. Sometimes I compare against desktop patterns as well.</p>

						<p>The phrase itself comes from a translation of an Aristotelian phrase rendered as "beg the question" but meaning "assume the conclusion."</p>
					</blockquote>
						<p>Sometimes with debugging it's easy to focus too much on solving the specific question that is placed in front of you: i.e., how do I make this thing accessible? When really, the premise is flawed: this is not an accessible design to start with.</p>

					<!-- TODO: graphic here -->
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>To debug this one, there is no trick. There is spec you can go to.</p>
						<p>The root cause of this isn't technical, but a design flaw: the idea that a uniform height is more visually pleasing + that this matters more than understandability and access.</p>
						<p>No one is going to your website to appreciate the art of your graphic design. They want to consume your content or use your app.</p>
						<p>Let's be clear, this affects a number of people:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Low vision/zoom -- even if you can get the tooltip, it's more work to read each line, and likely each line will need a tooltip to read the full text</li>
							<li>Someone who relies on the keyboard, switch, eye gaze</li>
							<li>ANYONE ON MOBILE/TABLET, JESUS CHRIST</li>
							<li>Higher cognitive load to read lines, can't read all of them at once, so potentially short term memory issues too. It's like playing a terrible version of the memory card game.</li>

						<p>I chose ant design because it came up first when I googled "most popular UI library of 2020." Those stats are actually on the good side of the UI libraries I checked. This is super rough and experimental, so take it with a lot of salt and critical thinking. I'd love feedback on it.</p>

					<h3>This sounds hopeful, but...</h3>
					<img src="./assets/github-nope.png" alt="screenshot of multiple github labels and responses on accessibility issues, including a bot auto-closing an issue as stale; issues labeled won't fix, enhancement, and low priority; and a contributor commenting that it's something they would like, but not on the roadmap.">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>All the tips in the world won't help if there aren't enough open source projects out there that really do prioritize accessibility. And most do not, or not enough. The whole ecosystem is flawed, and there's no magic shortcut around it, or solution to this.</p>

					<h2>This talk is about:</h2>
					<img src="./assets/rage-work.jpg" alt="aggretsuko, an aggrieved red panda, working furiously at her computer as papers go flying" style="width: 80%;">
					<p class="fragment">frustration.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>(intentional repeat)</p>
						This talk is about that feeling when you've been working on one problem for far too long, and you still have no idea how to solve it.

					<img src="./assets/fire.jpg" alt="Aggretsuko, still in office mode with an obviously fake smile, holds her coffee cup while entirely surrounded by background flames. It really seems like her eye must be twitching.">
					<p>...lots of frustration.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>And the thing is, that feeling of frustration is never going to fully go away, no matter how much we learn. Because there will always be a deeper problem to find. And the more you learn and the more time we spend in this field, the deeper the roots you find go, and the deeper the frustration starts to run.</p>
						<p>it's also not just a11y, </p>
						<p>Without any checks, that sort of frustration can easily lead to defeatism and burnout.</p>

					<p>...but it's better with friends.</p>
					<img src="./assets/better-with-friends.png" alt="aggretsuko screams into a karaoke mic while sharing wine with two of her friends">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>But this talk is also about the better option:</p>
						<p>Sometimes the best way to make progress on a seemingly impossible task is to find other people and other perspectives.</p>
						<p>The ultimate tool to debugging accessibility is sometimes just to be kind to yourself, and find people who you can share, rant, cry, or maybe just sing death metal in a karaoke bar with plenty of wine.</p>
